## Environment and Running

It's possible but not necesary to install and setup lua environment for the system.
The compiled environment is placed in the environment folder under the root directory of this repository.
However, this will make it impossible to debug with integrated tools.

**Use the following command to run your Lua scripts:**

```bash
run.sh script_name.lua
```
